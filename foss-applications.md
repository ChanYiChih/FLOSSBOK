**Open Source Infrastructure**

Open source Infrastructure generally is defined as the free open source tools that can support the software daily running and maintenance. This includes the basic network communication, operating system and some security tools, the classification are as follow:

1.HTTP Accelerator

Http accelerators, also called "Reverse Proxy" are implemented on the side of Internet servers. They have different uses such as: security, load balancing, SSL acceleration, compression and cache. It is especially this last point that we evaluate in this section. Internet users "pass" through the proxy reverses to access applications from internal servers. Advanced caching policies can unload Web application servers regardless of the language used. Some HTTP accelerators manage the cache fragment including supporting ESI standard.

2.Cloud Computing

One of the key ideas concealed behind the somewhat vague concept of cloud computing is the abstraction of an application's platform at various levels.

This can include IaaS \(Infrastructure as a Service\) in particular, but also PaaS \(Platform as a Service\) and SaaS \(Software as a Service\).

Naturally, virtualisation is crucial to setting up IaaS. However, it requires making virtual machines available in a completely automated manner. Monitoring of resource use for billing purposes is part of the cloud computing business model and so should be an integral part of any IaaS solution. The product should also handle the automatic configuration of a permanent storage space for VMs, as well as providing for their network connectivity.

For organisations wishing to build their own IaaS, open source solutions like OpenStack are now available and make it possible to industrialise virtualisation.

3.Remote Computer Control

More and more remote computer control solutions are becoming available, and their technology has advanced impressively in recent years.

These tools were initially created to meet user support and assistance needs. They can, as needed, be either localised or spread across some or all of a companyâ€™s client workstations.

They are used to respond to the different issues encountered at companies, including shared views of computers and file transfers.

The open source range in this category includes tools like TightVNC and OpenSSH. The latter is the favourite among systems administrators in the world of UNIX servers.4.Security

5.VPN

A virtual private network \(VPN\) extends a private network across a public network, and enables users to send and receive data across shared or public networks as if their computing devices were directly connected to the private network. Applications running across the VPN may therefore benefit from the functionality, security, and management of the private network.

6.Linux & BSD Operating System

FreeBSD is a free and open source Unix-like operating system descended from Research Unix via the Berkeley Software Distribution \(BSD\). Although for legal reasons FreeBSD cannot use the Unix trademark, it is a direct descendant of BSD, which was historically also called "BSD Unix" or "Berkeley Unix". The first version of FreeBSD was released in 1993, and today FreeBSD is the most widely used open-source BSD distribution, accounting for more than three-quarters of all installed systems running open-source BSD derivatives.

1.**Top 5 Open Source Project Management Tools: **Tuleap Open ALM, OrangeScrum,Taiga, Odoo,MyCollab

MyCollab is a multi-purpose solution which features tools for customer relationship management, document management, and project management. In this case, let's look at MyCollab-Project.

MyCollab-Project includes many features, like a Gantt chart and milestones, time tracking, and issue management. It also supports agile development models with its Kanban board. MyCollab-Project comes in three editions, of which the community edition is the free and open source option.

The current MyCollab version is 5.2.9 released on March 14, 2016. With a previous release, 5.2.6, mobile readiness has been greatly improved.

MyCollab is licensed under AGPLv3, requires a Java runtime and MySQL stack, and the source code is available on GitHub.

ne. 

Odoo is a multiplatform solution, supporting Windows, several Linux distributions, and other operating systems as well.

The community edition is, of course, free and open source, but limited in features compared to the enterprise version. Odoo project management has some interesting features, such as Gantt charts, a Kanban view, tasks and issues, graphs, and more. Notable assets are the community resources, and its official Docker image.

Odoo is licensed under GPLv3, and requires Python and PostgreSQL. Its latest release, 9.0, is available for download and as source on GitHub.
