# Why do we use Machine Learning?

#### **Use cases and Applications of machine learning**

Machine Learning these days is used in different technology applications. Machine learning has become pervasive in our day to day lives. Machine learning is used in different industries ranging from Banking to Marketing to FinTech to Healthcare. Machine learning also has advanced use cases like Image recognition and Speech recognition.

**Computer Vision/Image Recognition**

Image recognition is one of the key use cases of Machine Learning. For example TensorFlow \(open source machine learning framework\) has Object detection API that can be used for advanced computer vision use cases.Object detection API is used to detect multiple images in an object.

**Speech Recognition**

Speech recognition is another important use case of Machine learning. Advanced machine learning models are used to detect speeches. Typically deep learning algorithms are used in Speech recognition.

**Banking and FinTech Industry**

An example use case for machine learning in Banking industry is Fraudulent Credit card transactions. For example supervised learning can be used to make algorithms learn about expected transactions a customer might perform using his/her credit card. The algorithm learns from the customer data and can predict whether a credit card transaction is fraudulent or not.

**Marketing Industry**

An example use case of Machine Learning in Marketing industry is targeted ads. Companies use machine learning algorithms to learn about customer shopping patterns and then target ads based on those patterns. Targeted ads range from Amazon product recommendations to Google search ads to Facebook ads. As more and more people throughout the world start to get online and access internet, more Machine learning algorithms are used to learn about people’s shopping habits and target ads accordingly.  


**Healthcare Industry**

Machine Learning algorithms are used extensively in healthcare industry. Machine learning algorithms are used in personalized healthcare. The algorithms are used to learn about patient’s medical history and then personalize treatment based on patient’s history. Machine Algorithms are also used in disease identification and diagnosis.
