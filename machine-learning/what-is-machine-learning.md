### What is Machine Learning?

#### Introduction to Machine Learning

Machine Learning represents a machine’s \(computer\) ability to learn from data and provide predictions.  


As Machine learning is based on learning from data and making predictions, statistical models play a big role in Machine Learning. Machine Learning takes it roots from pattern recognition. Historically Machine learning was born from the theory that computers can learn without being programmed to perform specific tasks.             \[1\]

Machine learning involves 5 main steps as follows:**  


1. Collect Data : Machine learning algorithms rely on learning from past data. The Data needs to be checked of quality \(Data Quality\) so that the algorithm is learning from right data sets.
2. Train Algorithm: The next step is to train the algorithm with all the data. Machine Learning algorithms need to be trained with data. Typically, Machine learning algorithms get better as they learn more data. So it is advised to have more data sets so that Machine learning algorithms can predict more accurately.
3. Try it out / Make predictions: Once the Machine Learning Algorithm is trained with all the data, then you can try the algorithm and let the algorithm make predictions based on the data it learnt.
4. Collect feedback: The next step in the process is to collect feedback on the Algorithm’s predictions which means more data. This could include gathering feedback from the relevant consumers or customers for whom the machine learning algorithm is used.
5. Loop feedback back into the algorithm: After more data is collected in the form of feedback, this new data should be fed back into the machine learning algorithm so that the algorithm can learn from the new data.

#### Comparing Machine Learning and Statistics Terminology

Machine learning is based on statistical models. In this section we will compare Machine learning terminology with Statistics terminology.  


| **Statistics Terminology** | **Machine Learning Terminology** |
| :--- | :--- |
| A target is called a dependent variable in Statistics | A target is called a Label in Machine Learning |
| Variable | Feature. A variable in statistics is called a feature in Machine learning |
| Transformation | Feature Creation. A transformation in Statistics is called feature creation in Machine learning. |
