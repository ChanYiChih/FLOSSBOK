# Different methods of Machine Learning

#### **Types of Machine Learning Algorithms and Methods**

In the machine learning framework described in the “Introduction to Machine Learning” section, we mentioned about training the Machine learning algorithm. In this section, let us look at some Machine Learning Algorithms.

**Supervised Learning**

In supervised learning, the machine or algorithm is taught by providing the input and output examples and hence the name supervised learning. The machine \(algorithm\) learns from the input and output examples and then starts to make correlations and then predicts the outcomes. In this model, the machine is trained or supervised to learn from patterns of data. Common techniques used by supervised learning include the following:                                                          **** \[7\]  


* Decision Trees
* Forecasting
* Neural Networks
* Regression Analysis

**Practical Applications:** Some of the practical applications of Supervised learning algorithms include Image, Speech and text recognition, Personalized ads targeting and Fraud detection. For example, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, the banking industry can use supervised learning algorithms.                                                               \[7\]

**Semi-supervised Learning**

In semi-supervised learning, some of the input data that is fed into the machine/algorithm is labeled \(with defined answer/output\) while the remainder of the input data is not labeled with any defined answer/output. Common techniques used by Semi-Supervised are the same as Supervised learning mentioned above.                                                                                              \[7\]  


**Practical Applications:** Just like the practical applications of Supervised learning algorithms, Semi-supervised algorithms are used in Speech recognition, image recognition. Semi-supervised learning has also practical applications in web page classifications.                                                                                  \[7\]

**Unsupervised Learning**

In unsupervised learning the machine learns from data to identify the patterns. In unsupervised learning, the machine is not provided with any output. The machine is just provided with input data and the machine learns from data and identifies patterns.  Unsupervised learning is modeled on human behavior - that is how human beings observe and learn things and then draw inferences. In Unsupervised learning also, the machine follows the similar model as human behavior that is the machine learns from the input data and starts identifying patterns and makes inferences. In this model, the more data the machine learns the more accurately the machine can detect patterns and draw inferences. Common techniques used by Unsupervised learning include the following:      \[7\]  


* Affinity Analysis
* Clustering
* Nearest-neighbor mapping   

**Practical Applications:** Unsupervised learning has practical applications in security systems and can be used in Intrusion detection systems.     \[7\]

**Reinforcement Learning**

Reinforcement learning is very similar to teaching a human being how to play a game. In reinforcement learning, the machine/algorithm is fed with defined set of rules, actions and potential end states. The machine learns the rules and then explores different actions and then based on the resulting reactions, the machine creates a desirable outcome. Common techniques used by Unsupervised    learning include the following: \[7\]  


* Artificial Neural Networks
* Q-Learning

**Practical Applications:** Reinforcement learning algorithms have practical applications in gaming industry. Reinforcement learning algorithms also have practical applications in Robotics and Maps navigation.                \[7\]
