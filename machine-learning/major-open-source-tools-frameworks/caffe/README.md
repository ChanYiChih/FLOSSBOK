# Caffe

Caffe stands for Convolutional architecture for fast feature embedding. Caffe is an open source deep learning framework that is developed by UC Berkeley. Caffe’s salient features include Speed and modularity. Because Caffe is built with Speed as a salient feature Caffe is used for research experiments as well as industry deployment.

Caffe’s modular architecture facilitates for code extensibility there by fostering more innovation from the open source community.
