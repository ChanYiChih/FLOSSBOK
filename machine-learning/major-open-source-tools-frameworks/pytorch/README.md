PyTorch is an open source machine learning framework that is developed by Facebook. PyTorch is the machine learning framework for Python and is based on Torch. PyTorch is not a Python binding into another programming language but it is built to be deeply integrated into python. Compared to computational graphs of TensorFlow, the computational graphs of PyTorch are more dynamic that is the computational graphs can be modified on the go.                   \[8\]  


PyTorch is mainly targeted at two sets of audiences:  


1. “A replacement for NumPy to use the power of GPUs”
2. “A deep learning research platform that provides maximum flexibility and speed”       \[9\]
