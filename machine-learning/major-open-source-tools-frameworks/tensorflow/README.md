# TensorFlow

TensorFlow is an open source machine learning software library developed by google. TensorFlow aims to make it easier for developers to build, test and train deep learning neural network models.                                                                                              \[3\]

**History of TensorFlow**

In 2011, Google developed a proprietary Machine Learning system called DistBelief which was based on deep learning neural networks. In 2015 Google open sourced this technology as TensorFlow. Google uses TensorFlow machine learning in lot of its products like Google photos, speech recognition systems, Gmail and Google search.    \[4\]

**TensorFlow Architecture**

TensorFlow has cross-platform architecture. TensorFlow can run on CPUs, GPUs, mobile and embedded platforms. As shown in the TensorFlow architecture diagram below, TensorFlow execution engine abstracts the many underlying devices that TensorFlow architecture supports. As the underlying devices are abstracted TensorFlow can support a variety of front end frameworks like Python front end and C++ front end. The layers API sitting on top of front end layer provides APIs to build commonly used deep learning models. On top of Layers API are higher level APIs like Keras and Estimator that make training and evaluating models easier.   \[2\]
