# Repository

In open source software development, a repository is a file archive and web hosting facility where a large amount of[ ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code)source code and project meta data is kept, either publicly or privately. A repository is often used for multi-developer cooperation and software version controls. Repositories help developers submit patches of code in an organized fashion.

## Types and management of repository 

Each revision control system handles storing changes differently. Traditionally, subversions are stored into databases. Nowadays, solutions directly on the filesystem or on the cloud is becoming more common.

Depending on the version control system, whether it is centralized or distributed, the whole set of information in the repository may be duplicated on every user's system or may be maintained on a single server.

## Components of repository

Some of the metadata that a repository contains includes, among other things:

* A historical record of changes in the repository.
* A set of commit objects.
* A set of references to commit objects, called heads.

## Features to consider when choose your software repository

* What functionality do you need now?
* Access Control \(e.g. setting up project level roles\)
* How easy is it to upgrade to additional functionality in the future?
* What is your preferred version-control system, e.g. CVS, SVN, Git, Mercurial?
* Is it important to have your code publicly available?
* Are all your code committers local?
* How easy is it to integrate other things you run separately \(e.g. a website\) with the repository?
* How good is the support for your IDEs of choice?
* Is there support for authentication systems such as OpenID or SSH keys?
* What additional forge, social networking, project-management functionality do you want from the site? e.g. GitHub is good for social coolness
* Where are similar projects to yours hosted?
* What's the speed of upload/download?
* How easy is it to backup the entire repository \(code, mailing lists, issue tickets, ...\)
* How established and stable is the repository?
* How good is the user support?
* How much effort do you have to put into repository maintenance?
* Would it be better to use more than one repository, e.g. code stored in GitHub and a link to Assembla for its extra tools?
* What are the Service Level Agreements for uptime, downtime, time to fix outages and bandwidth?

## Examples of repository web hosting service

The interfaces of an online repository often appears to be a webpage, where there are version control \(including online code viewing\), bug/issue tracking, release management, mailing lists, statistics reporting \(e.g. number of commits, number of downloads\) and wiki-based documentation.

Project/release managementThere are many repository web hosting services, such as

* Github
* BitBucket
* ProjectLocker
* Cloud Forge
* Source forge
* Launchpad
* Assembla
* Codeplex
* Freepository
* Codebase

## Example case study

### Github

[GitHub](https://github.com/)  
[GitHub - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GitHub)

GitHub is a web-based Git or version control repository and Internet hosting service. It offers all of the distributed version control and source code management \(SCM\) functionality of Git as well as adding its own features.  It provides access control and several collaboration features such as bug tracking, feature requests, task management, and wikis for every project.

Any user could register a github account and then create his own project repository. The repository could be either private or public. Usually, the repository is licensed with a particular license \(LISENSE.TXT/LICENSE\) and an introduction file \(README/README.md\).

Using the git version control system, a user could create his local repository on his machine, add files and commit to it. With github repository, the user could push/pull changes in the remote repository and keep the file changes synchronized between local and the cloud.

### Source Forge

[SourceForge](https://sourceforge.net/)  
[SourceForge - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SourceForge)

SourceForge is a Web-based service that offers software developers a centralized online location to control and manage free and open source software projects. It provides a source code repository.  
Users can create their projects on sourceforge easily.
