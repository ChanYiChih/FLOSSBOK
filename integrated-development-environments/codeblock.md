# Code::Blocks

Code::Blocks** **is a free, open-source cross-platform IDE that supports multiple compilers including GCC, Clang and Visual C++. It is developed in C++ using wxWidgets as the GUI toolkit. Using a plugin architecture, its capabilities and features are defined by the provided plugins. Currently, Code::Blocks is oriented towards C, C++ and Fortran. It has a custom build system and optional Make support.

Code::Blocks is being developed for Windows, Linux, and macOS and has been ported to FreeBSD, OpenBSD and Solaris.

## Features

### Compilers

Code::Blocks supports multiple compilers, including GCC, MinGW, Digital Mars, Microsoft Visual C++, Borland C++, LLVM Clang, Watcom, LCC and the Intel C++ compiler. Although the IDE was designed for the C++ language, there is some support for other languages, including Fortran and D. A plug-in system is included to support other programming languages.

### Code editor

The IDE features syntax highlighting and code folding\(through its Scintilla editor component\), C++ code completion, class browser, a hex editor and many other utilities. Opened files are organized into tabs. The code editor supports font and font size selection and personalized syntax highlighting colors.

### Debugger

The Code::Blocks debugger has full breakpoint support. It also allows the user to debug their program by having access to the local function symbol and argument display, user-defined watches, call stack, disassembly, custom memory dump, thread switching, CPU registers and GNU Debugger Interface.

### GUI designer

As of version 13.12 Code::Blocks comes with a GUI designer called wxSmith. It is a derivative port of wxWidgets version 2.9.4. To make a complete wxWidgets application, the appropriate wxWidgets SDK must be installed.

### User migration

Some of Code::Blocks features are targeted at users migrating from other IDE's - these include Dev-C++, Microsoft Visual C++ project import \(MSVC 7 & 10\), and Dev-C++ Devpak support.

### Project files and build system

Code::Blocks uses a custom build system, which stores its information in XML-based project files. It can optionally use external makefiles, which simplifies interfacing with projects using the GNU or [qmake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qmake) build systems.
