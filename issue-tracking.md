# Issue Tracking

Issue tracking is essential in software engineering process since no software systems can guarantee bug-free. It is especially important to open source projects as they encourage contributions from the public. An issue tracking system should provide enough fields to describe what an issues is about, such as title, content, status, priority, date, assignee, and many others. Also the system should be user friendly and enable members to browse through the issues easily.  


Many open source issue tracking solutions are available on the market, such as Bugzilla, Redmine, Trac, Basecamp, and JIRA. For some solutions, issue tracking is just a part of all the features they could offer. In a sense, they are more like project management tools \(e.g. Redmine, JIRA, and Basecamp\). Since these solutions vary in features and complexities, proper evaluations should be done when selecting one. Usability is one of the important criteria as they encourage bug reporting and contributions among members.  


After an issue is reported in the system, it could be assigned to members with expertise. For open source projects, any volunteers can also choose to work on that issue. An issue reported should be first verified to see if it is valid. This involves recreating the problem based on the report. When further information is required, the issue assignee may reach the reporter for more evidence. To facilitate that, a qualified issue tracking system should present these communications with respect to the issue in an easy-to-follow manner. This could also encourage more people to participate in resolving the issue.  


Bug triage meetings sometimes are necessary during development cycle, especially when the number of open bugs are high and the release date is approaching. Issue tracking system plays an important role at this time as it helps the management team sort out all open issues with priority and decide which of them should be fixed before shipping the product.
