# FOSS Definition and Principles

Let’s talk about what open source is and why people do it.

## What Does “Open Source” Mean?

When a project is open source, that means anybody can view, use, modify, and distribute your project for any purpose. These permissions are enforced through an open source license. Open source is powerful because it lowers the barriers to adoption, allowing ideas to spread quickly.

To understand how it works, imagine your friend is having a potluck, and you bring a cherry pie.

* Everybody tries the pie \(use\)
* The pie is a hit! They ask you for the recipe, which you provide \(view\)
* One friend, Alex, who’s a pastry chef, suggests reducing the sugar \(modify\)
* Another friend, Lisa, asks to use it for a dinner next week \(distribute\)

By comparison, a closed source process would be going to a restaurant and ordering a slice of cherry pie. You must pay a fee to eat the pie, and the restaurant probably won’t give you their recipe. If you copied their pie exactly and sold it under your own name, the restaurant could take action against you.

## Why do people open source their work?

[There are many reasons](http://ben.balter.com/2015/11/23/why-open-source/) why a person or organization would want to open source a project. Some examples include:

* **Collaboration:**Open source projects can accept changes from anybody in the world. [Exercism](https://github.com/exercism/), for example, is a programming exercise platform with over 350 contributors.

* **Adoption and remixing:**Open source projects can be used by anyone for nearly any purpose. People can even use it to build other things. [WordPress](https://github.com/WordPress), for example, started as a fork of an existing project called [b2](https://github.com/WordPress/book/blob/master/Content/Part 1/2-b2-cafelog.md).

* **Transparency:**Anyone can inspect an open source project for errors or inconsistencies. Transparency matters to governments like [Bulgaria](https://medium.com/@bozhobg/bulgaria-got-a-law-requiring-open-source-98bf626cf70a) or the [United States](https://sourcecode.cio.gov/), regulated industries like banking or healthcare, and security software like [Let’s Encrypt](https://github.com/letsencrypt).

Open source isn’t just for software, either. You can open source everything from datasets to books. Check out [GitHub Explore](https://github.com/explore) for ideas on what else you can open source.

## Does Open Source Mean “Free of Charge”?

One of open source’s biggest draws is that it does not cost money. “Free of charge”, however, is a byproduct of open source’s overall value.

Because [an open source license requires](https://opensource.org/osd-annotated) that anyone can use, modify, and share your project for nearly any purpose, projects themselves tend to be free of charge. If the project cost money to use, anyone could legally make a copy and use the free version instead.

As a result, most open source projects are free, but “free of charge” is not part of the open source definition. There are ways to charge for open source projects indirectly through dual licensing or limited features, while still complying with the official definition of open source.
