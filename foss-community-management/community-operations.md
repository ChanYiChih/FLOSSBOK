#### Operation Of Community:

1. Use version control: the version control is aim to distinguish each team member's contribution and return to the previous version if there is need to roll back to the previous version.

A component of [software configuration management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_configuration_management) ,version control, also known as revision control or source control,[\[1\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control#cite_note-Mercurial-1)is the management of changes to documents,[computer programs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program), large web sites, and other collections of information. Changes are usually identified by a number or letter code, termed the "revision number", "revision level", or simply "revision". For example, an initial set of files is "revision 1". When the first change is made, the resulting set is "revision 2", and so on. Each revision is associated with a [timestamp](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timestamp) and the person making the change. Revisions can be compared, restored, and with some types of files, merged.

The need for a logical way to organize and control revisions has existed for almost as long as [writing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Writing) has existed, but revision control became much more important, and complicated, when the era of computing began. The numbering of [book editions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edition_%28book%29) and of [specification revisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Specification_%28technical_standard%29) are examples that date back to the print-only era. Today, the most capable \(as well as complex\) revision control systems are those used in [software development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_development), where a team of people may change the same files.

2.Use effective communication tools: Let each contributors have an effective communication way to share the ideas, they can use email or slack or other effective ways.

All good open-source projects give people a place to go to ask questions, and the easiest way to achieve that is by setting up a mailing list.

Setting up a mailing list with [Yahoo Groups](http://groups.yahoo.com/) or [Google Groups](http://groups.google.com/) is easy and free. Make sure to do that before announcing the project’s availability, and actively encourage people to use the mailing list to ask questions. Link to the mailing list prominently on the website \(if you have one\) or in the documentation.

The other important part of running a mailing list is to actively monitor it. Nothing is more frustrating for end users or contributors than being ignored. If you’ve set up a mailing list, take the time to monitor it and respond to people who ask questions. This is the best way to foster a community of developers around the project. Getting a decent amount of traffic onto the mailing list can take some time, but it’s worth the effort. Offer advice to people who want to contribute; suggest to people to file tickets when appropriate \(don’t let the mailing list turn into a bug tracker!\); and use the feedback you get from the mailing list to improve documentation.

3.Start a committee: For some project, the committee is a necessary way to start a committee,  they can hire some high level and experienced engineers to monitor the change and commit to the project, and decide whether the commit can be merged into the project.
