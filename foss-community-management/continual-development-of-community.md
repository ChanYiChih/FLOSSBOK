# Continual Development of Community

There are several best practices you need to follow to have a better community that can develop continually:

–**Don’t tolerate bad actors:** When an open source project starts, there will always be good people who contribute to the project to make the project better. But there will also be bad people who will do harm to the project and the community. So at this time, you will need to stand out and adopt zero-tolerance policy towards those people. If you just neglect or endure them, this would make things even worse and make other good people in your community uncomfortable, lose the faith and even leave. What's more, this kind of situation would distract you and others from focusing on what's really important and this situation would make new participants do not want to participate in your community. So the best practice is that when you see negative behavior, just call it out publicly and explain to them why their behavior is unacceptable in a kind but firm tone. If they persist their behavior, you need to ask them to leave. Your code of conduct can be a constructive guide for these conversations.

–**Meet contributors where they’re at: **Your community needs to be always kind to new participants. So in order to make them start your project easily, you need to have good documentation and explain explicitly how they can get started. You may even want to make a dedicated section for this purpose. Django, for example, has a special landing page to welcome new contributors.![](/assets/import.png)Good documentation should also always have a good records of project's issues and bugs. So label bugs that are suitable for different types of contributors: for example,“first timers only”,“good first bug”, or“documentation”.These labels make it easy for someone new to your project to quickly scan your issues and get started.

Finally, make people feel welcome at every step of the way. Leave a few kind words can keep someone from leaving your project in frustration.

–**Share ownership of your project:** People are more willing to contribute themselves if they have the ownership of the project. So you can share your ownership with your community as much as possible. This doesn't mean you will totally lose your ownership or you will need to accept some behaviors or contribution that you don't want to. But the more you give credit to others, the better they will do. Here are some ideas that can help you to share your ownership:

* **Recruit new contributors or mentor someone to fix easy bugs **instead doing this by yourself. This can be a good start point for new participants and your investment will pay off over time.
* **Lists everyone who has contributed to your project** in** **a CONTRIBUTORS or AUTHORS file in your project.
* If you’ve got a bigger community, **send out a newsletter or write a blog post to **thank contributors.
* **Give every contributor commit access. **This would make people more willing to contribute to projects and attract more maintainers.
* If your project is on GitHub, **move your project from your personal account to an Organization **and add at least one backup admin. Organizations make it easier to work on projects with external collaborators.

Most projects only have one or two maintainers who do most of the work. So if you can make your project bigger and your community bigger, the easier it is to find help.

–**Barriers to entry**: Understand the barriers that contributors will need to overcome, such as using unusual tools, convoluted processes for bug reporting, feature requests or patch acceptation, or legal forms you may ask people to sign before contributing. And try to make these barriers easier for contributors.

–**Tools and infrastructure**: Ensure that you provide your users with the opportunity to distribute their work and connect with other users. Contributing in your project should be seen as a social experience.

–**Community processes**: Create a just environment – no-one likes to be considered a second class citizen. Document processes for gaining access to key resources like bug moderator permissions, commit access to the master branch, or editor access for the project website.

–**Budget appropriately**: Commit the appropriate resources – building a community takes time and effort, and that means investment – primarily of human resources.Having one guy who is the community manager dealing with the community and a team of 10 developers behind the corporate walls isn’t going to cut it. As Josh Berkus of PostgreSQL said in his “How to Kill your community” presentation, if your nascent community feels neglected, it will just go away.

Launching a new project is like launching a new product – except that acquiring a new community developer takes much longer, and is much more difficult and costly than acquiring a new user. In the same way that companies track SAC for new product launches, tracking the Developer Acquisition Cost \(DAC\) for your project is a key metric in evaluating whether you are doing the right things to grow your community.

Developers have lots of projects to choose from, and they tend to gravitate towards projects where co-development is the norm. So you have to be thinking about the contributor experience, and the value proposition to external contributors, all the time.

A clear and compelling vision, with lots of opportunities to contribute, and low barriers to collaboration, can help reduce the acquisition cost of community contributors, and similarly reduce the cost of acquiring new users and paying customers.
