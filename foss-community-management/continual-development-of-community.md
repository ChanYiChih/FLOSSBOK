# Continual Development of Community

If you want to grow a community around your project, there are a few best practices you should follow:

–**Control**: If you opt for rules ensuring that you decide what code will be added to your product’s core, you will lose many of the benefits of community projects. Some examples of rules which come from a desire to maintain control are a requirement to assign copyright for all contributions to the core product to you, or ensuring that only employees can commit directly to the main branch of your core product. There are many good reasons to maintain ownership of the core, but this decision will severely handicap community contributions. This does not prevent you from developing other types of community, however, such as a community of add-on developers or integrators.

–**Don’t tolerate bad actors: **Any popular project will inevitably attract people who harm, rather than help, your community. They may start unnecessary debates, quibble over trivial features, or bully others.

Do your best to adopt a zero-tolerance policy towards these types of people. If left unchecked, negative people will make other people in your community uncomfortable. They may even leave.

Regular debates over trivial aspects of your project distracts others, including you, from focusing on important tasks. New people who arrive to your project may see these conversations and not want to participate.

When you see negative behavior happening on your project, call it out publicly. Explain, in a kind but firm tone, why their behavior is not acceptable. If the problem persists, you may need to ask them to leave. Your code of conduct can be a constructive guide for these conversations.

–**Meet contributors where they’re at: **Good documentation only becomes more important as your community grows. Casual contributors, who may not otherwise be familiar with your project, read your documentation to quickly get the context they need.

In your CONTRIBUTING file, explicitly tell new contributors how to get started. You may even want to make a dedicated section for this purpose. Django, for example, has a special landing page to welcome new contributors.![](/assets/import.png)In your issue queue, label bugs that are suitable for different types of contributors: for example,“first timers only”,“good first bug”, or“documentation”.These labels make it easy for someone new to your project to quickly scan your issues and get started.

Finally, use your documentation to make people feel welcome at every step of the way.

You will never interact with most people who land on your project. There may be contributions you didn’t receive because somebody felt intimidated or didn’t know where to get started. Even a few kind words can keep someone from leaving your project in frustration.

–**Share ownership of your project:**People are excited to contribute to projects when they feel a sense of ownership. That doesn’t mean you need to turn over your project’s vision or accept contributions you don’t want. But the more you give credit to others, the more they’ll stick around.

See if you can find ways to share ownership with your community as much as possible. Here are some ideas:

* **Resist fixing easy \(non-critical\) bugs. **Instead, use them as opportunities to recruit new contributors, or mentor someone who’d like to contribute. It may seem unnatural at first, but your investment will pay off over time.
* **Start a CONTRIBUTORS or AUTHORS file in your project **that lists everyone who’s contributed to your project.
* If you’ve got a sizeable community, **send out a newsletter or write a blog post **thanking contributors.
* **Give every contributor commit access. **This made people more excited to polish their patches, and there would be new maintainers for projects .
* If your project is on GitHub, **move your project from your personal account to an Organization **and add at least one backup admin. Organizations make it easier to work on projects with external collaborators.

The reality is that most projects only have one or two maintainers who do most of the work. The bigger your project, and the bigger your community, the easier it is to find help.

While you may not always find someone to answer the call, putting a signal out there increases the chances that other people will pitch in. And the earlier you start, the sooner people can help.

–**Barriers to entry**: Barriers that contributors have to overcome can come in different shapes: using unusual tools, requiring convoluted processes for bug reporting, feature requests or patch acceptation, or legal forms you may ask people to sign before contributing.

–**Tools and infrastructure**: Ensure that you provide your users with the opportunity to distribute their work and connect with other users – whether this be through a forge for modules, or through the use of Gitorious of Bazaar for source control. Contributing in your project should be seen as a social experience.

–**Community processes**: Create a just environment – no-one likes to be considered a second class citizen. Document processes for gaining access to key resources like bug moderator permissions, commit access to the master branch, or editor access for the project website.

–**Budget appropriately**: Commit the appropriate resources – building a community takes time and effort, and that means investment – primarily of human resources.Having one guy who is the community manager dealing with the community and a team of 10 developers behind the corporate walls isn’t going to cut it. As Josh Berkus of PostgreSQL said in his “How to Kill your community” presentation, if your nascent community feels neglected, it will just go away.

Launching a new project is like launching a new product – except that acquiring a new community developer takes much longer, and is much more difficult and costly than acquiring a new user. In the same way that companies track SAC for new product launches, tracking the Developer Acquisition Cost \(DAC\) for your project is a key metric in evaluating whether you are doing the right things to grow your community.

Developers have lots of projects to choose from, and they tend to gravitate towards projects where co-development is the norm. So you have to be thinking about the contributor experience, and the value proposition to external contributors, all the time.

A clear and compelling vision, with lots of opportunities to contribute, and low barriers to collaboration, can help reduce the acquisition cost of community contributors, and similarly reduce the cost of acquiring new users and paying customers.
