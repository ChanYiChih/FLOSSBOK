# Community Metrics

**Who contributes?**

* Summarize the primary classifications of the primary contributors to your community.
* Divide these by the types of value they bring, primarily in terms of different skills.

**How do they participate?**

* For each type of contributor that you just wrote down, also note how each interacts with your community to make those contributions. These should primarily be the processes and infrastructure they use to participate.

**What do they deliver?**

* For each group, write down what value they bring in a practical and measurable form.
