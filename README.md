# FLOSSBOK

FLOSSBOK course for OSS course @ CMU-SV

FLOSSBOK, defines the suitable Body of Knowledge related to Free, Libre, and Open Source Software. Following the approach used for SWEBOK and PMBOK, the idea is to identify topics that can be used for courses and individual study of FLOSS-related topics. The work would include a deep outline of topics, backed by citations to curated resources with the appropriate content.
