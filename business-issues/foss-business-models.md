# FOSS Business Models

There is still no proper understanding of FOSS profitability and business models. The most critical issue that needs to be understood when it comes to OSS business model is that according to the OSS licensing terms, free redistribution of licensed software is allowed. As redistribution of Software is allowed, it is not feasible to base revenue just on Licensing fees.

Following elements are [identified](http://is2.lse.ac.uk/asp/aspecis/20030126.pdf) by Rajala et al. as essential elements in any business model for software companies:

* _`product development`_
* _`source of revenue and pricing`_
* _`sales channel options`_
* _`servicing and implementation approach`_ [`[1]`](http://is2.lse.ac.uk/asp/aspecis/20030126.pdf)\`\`

Jussi Nissila identifies the key elements of any software business model in slightly different terms as follows:

* _`value creation and revenue logic`_
* _`market offerings and positioning`_
* _`product development, implementation and servicing`_

Jussi Nissila also argues that, in the case of open source business models, the above key elements must be complemented by the following:

_`i) extent of community development and review;`_

_`ii) style of development method as more open or more closed;`_

_`iii) license type as more restricted or more liberal; and`_

_`iv) importance of the OSS in the end product. Importance ranges from pure OSS where no proprietary components are added, OSS driven where the core is open source with proprietary component added, to proprietary software driven where the core is proprietary with some open source components added.`_

In OSS business models, [Dual Licensing](https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Dual_Licensing) seems to be one of the most popular ways of making money. Using Dual Licensing model, companies can make money from Open source software not only from the revenues that come from selling the license but also through technical support and services.

Technical support and services can provide a complementary revenue stream.

Following are the two legal requirements for a commercially successful dual-licensing model: 

_`i) the need for a license with a strong copyleft clause; and ii) possession of undisputed rights over the software.`_

## Business Models

### 1.Open Source Software Service Model:

Open source software service model is a well-established OSS business model. In this model, a company charges for services to support the use of Open source software. Many companies have implemented this business model as their core business model. Red Hat is one of the best example companies that has successfully used this business model and generated a [revenue](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-reports-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2018-results) of $2.9 Billion in the year 2017 and has a [market valuation](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RHT?p=RHT&.tsrc=fin-srch-v1) of $25.8 Billion as of July 2018. 

This business model benefits from large-scale adaption of open source software. For example, lot of companies use some kind of Linux distribution to run their compute servers. Red Hat's business model is primarily focused on the Linux open source software systems. Companies looking to embrace this business model need to focus on adding complementary services and products so that they can have multiple revenue streams. 

 Glyn Moody's recent post titled 'Why No Billion-Dollar Open Source Companies?' discusses about the challenges encountered by service based Open source Software business models.

### 2.Dual Licensing:

Dual Licensing is a well-established open source software business model that is based on dual \(or multiple\) license model approach. Typically, [Dual Licensing](http://www.timreview.ca/ojs/index.php/osbr/article/view/1157/1107) model has involved the combination of a reciprocal \(copyleft\) license with a more conventional commercial software license. 

MySQL license is an example of Dual Licensing model. MySQL licensed its database product under GPL \(GNU general public license\) and also as commercial software license. 

In Dual Licensing model, typically the software is first licensed under GPL for free so that it facilitates wide adoption of the software. Once the software has wide adoption, commercial license is offered with some additional features. 

Though Dual Licensing model is an established model it is a declining model. According to some studies, the use of dual licensing model among open source software vendors has declined in the past few years. One possible reason for this decline could be that open source vendors face challenges in creating and maintaining a code base that can be dual licensed.

### 3.Open Core Business Model:

Open core business model is somewhat established but still an emerging business model in Open source world. 

This business model is premised on offering the core software as open source license and then offers proprietary licenses of add-ons to the core open source software. A couple of good examples for this approach are SugarCRM and Word Press.

A company that is interested in this business model would first offer the core software as Open source license in order to drive the large scale adaption of the software. Once there is large scale adaption, then the company would follow up by offering proprietary add-ons. For example, in the case of SugarCRM the proprietary add-ons are in the form of new CRM modules or more scalability. In the case of Word Press, the proprietary add-ons are in the form of premium services as part of its hosted-service offering.

It is true that people have polarized opinions on Open Core business model but this business model does represent an important evolution in open source software business models.

### 4.Hybrid Open Source Software Business Model:

Hybrid Open source software business model is a novel business model which is based on commercial licensing of a software product. As part of the commercial licensing the source code is made available and then certain rights are given to modify and use the source code as part of the commercial license. 

One example of this business model is QNX which got acquired by Research in Motion Limited. Following are the 3 main components of this business model as described by QNX and Research in motion in their website:

_`1) open access to product source code; 2) a commercial-friendly licensing model that lets customers modify source code and retain ownership of their modifications; and 3) a transparent development process that allows customers and community members to participate in product development â€“ a benefit normally restricted to open source projects.`_ 

It is still early days for Hybrid open source software business model but it is an interesting business model when compared to existing open source software business models. Hybrid open source software model offers combination of openness, transparency and commercial licensing.

### 5.Entersource:

"Entersource" combines open source and enterprise software. Entersource model follows customer centric approach. 

Entersource model is considered as a means for collaborative development. In entersource model, developers from different enterprises collaborate across company boundaries in order to develop software components that can then be shared amongst all the companies under open licenses. This kind of collaborative open source development can achieve significant cost savings for companies. Entersource business model facilitates for engineers from different companies to work together and produce open source software components without months of legal work.

Considering that majority of open source projects do not achieve the needed critical mass, Entersource business model and its variants are an important addition to the open source software business model landscape.
