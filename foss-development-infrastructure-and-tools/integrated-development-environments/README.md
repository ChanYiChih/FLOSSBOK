# Integrated Development Environments

## What is IDE?

Integrated Development Environment is a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to programmers for software development by integrating a set of development tools. Normally, an IDE contains a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. More modern IDEs contain a compiler, interpreter, version control and so on.

## Why do we use IDE?

The reason of why we use IDE is that it can save developers time and improve the productivity. Unlike just using vi, which only provides an interface for developer to write code, IDE provides a more comfortable and easier way for developers to develop product. It integrates many essential tools that are needed during the development cycle, which have all been setup already. So developers don't need to waste time for setup again and again. And some advanced IDEs can form the directories of files or generate class hierarchy automatically to help developers to use objected-oriented design or MVC framework easily.

## Different Categories of IDE

IDEs can be categorized in many ways. For example, some IDEs are light weighted, such as sublime and bracket, which donâ€™t need much space to install and contain some basic functions such as source code editor and error detection, while other IDEs are not light weighted, such as Android Studio and Eclipse, which contain more functions and more comprehensive tools. Some IDEs support multiple languages, such as IntelliJ IDEA, while others can only support one specific language, such as PyCharm

## Examples of Open Source IDE

There are many good free open source IDEs that can be used for development in the FOSS community. Some of them are Eclipse, Android Studio, Code::Blocks which are all open source and provide very strong environment for open source software developers to develop FOSS.
