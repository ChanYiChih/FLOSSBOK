MyCollab is a multi-purpose solution which features tools for customer relationship management, document management, and project management. In this case, let's look at MyCollab-Project.

MyCollab-Project includes many features, like a Gantt chart and milestones, time tracking, and issue management. It also supports agile development models with its Kanban board. MyCollab-Project comes in three editions, of which the community edition is the free and open source option.

The current MyCollab version is 5.2.9 released on March 14, 2016. With a previous release, 5.2.6, mobile readiness has been greatly improved.

MyCollab is licensed under AGPLv3, requires a Java runtime and MySQL stack, and the source code is available on GitHub.

Odoo is a multiplatform solution, supporting Windows, several Linux distributions, and other operating systems as well.

The community edition is, of course, free and open source, but limited in features compared to the enterprise version. Odoo project management has some interesting features, such as Gantt charts, a Kanban view, tasks and issues, graphs, and more. Notable assets are the community resources, and its official Docker image.

Odoo is licensed under GPLv3, and requires Python and PostgreSQL. Its latest release, 9.0, is available for download and as source on GitHub.

2.**Top 4 Open Source Editors: **gedit,Geany,Sublime Text , jEdit

jEdit is a free software text editor available under the GNU General Public License version 2.0. It is written in Java and runs on any operating system with Java support, including BSD, Linux, macOS and Windows.

Sublime Text is a proprietary cross-platform source code editor with a Python application programming interface \(API\). It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages, and its functionality can be extended by users with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses.

Geany \(IPA:ʒeːniː\) is a lightweight GUI text editor using Scintilla and GTK+, including basic IDE features. It is designed to have short load times, with limited dependency on separate packages or external libraries on Linux. It has been ported to a wide range of operating systems, such as BSD, Linux, macOS, Solaris and Windows. Because Windows lacks a virtual terminal equivalent, the Windows port lacks an embedded terminal window. Also missing from the Windows version are the external development tools present under Unix, unless installed separately by the user. Among the supported programming languages and markup languages are C, C++, C\#, Java, JavaScript, PHP, HTML, LaTeX, CSS, Python, Perl, Ruby, Pascal, Haskell, Erlang, Vala and many others.

Leaflet is a widely used open source JavaScript library used to build web mapping applications. First released in 2011, it supports most mobile and desktop platforms, supporting HTML5 and CSS3. Along with OpenLayers, and the Google Maps API, it is one of the most popular JavaScript mapping libraries and is used by major web sites such as FourSquare, Pinterest and Flickr.

Leaflet allows developers without a GIS background to very easily display tiled web maps hosted on a public server, with optional tiled overlays. It can load feature data from GeoJSON files, style it and create interactive layers, such as markers with popups when clicked.
