# Project Creation

**Defining goals**: Identify what is your project's vision and what are target users

These days, it seems that anybody who writes a piece of code ends up pushing it to GitHub with an open-source license and says, “I’ve open-sourced it.” Creating an open-source project isn’t just about making your code freely available to others. So, before announcing to the world that you have open-sourced something that hasn’t been used by anyone other than you in your spare time, stop to ask yourself what your goals are for the project.

The first goal is always to create something useful.Make sure that what you’re offering is useful by looking for others who are doing similar projects and figuring out how large of a user base you’re looking at.

After that, decide why you are open-sourcing the project in the first place. Is it because you just want to share what you’ve done? Do you intend to continue developing the code, or is this just a snapshot that you’re putting out into the world? If you have no intention of continuing to develop the code, then the rest of this article doesn’t apply to you. Make sure that the readme file in your repository states this clearly so that anyone who finds your project isn’t confused.

If you are going to continue developing the code, do you want to accept contributions from others? If not, then, once again, this article doesn’t apply to you. If yes, then you have some work to do. Creating an open-source project that’s conducive to outside contributions is more work than it seems. You have to create environments in which those who are unfamiliar with the project can get up to speed and be productive reasonably quickly, and that takes some planning.

**Choosing A License: **The license is aim to protect the contributors' right



**Documentation: **Document the basic rules for the FOSS, decide an order for the community to follow.

**Use Version Numbers: **The version number is aim to provide a mechanism to provide

**Managing Contributions: **Allow committee to supervise each merge on the project to ensure the safety of the project.
