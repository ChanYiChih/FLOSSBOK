# Project Leadership/Governance

Open source project leadership/governance, is different from traditional projects. In most companies or organizations, the management is top-down, meaning instructions coming from VP get conveyed to directors, then managers and finally employees. Open source communities and their projects rarely function in that way. Compared to the top-down hierarchical approach, another way is crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is a specific sourcing model in which individuals or organizations use contributions from Internet users to obtain needed services or ideas.

So how are open source projects and communities led? Often in a project, there are different teams responsible for different parts and different features. Teams are loosely coupled, and each team has a team leader. The leaders will not go about how things must be done. In open source project, people often volunteer to do some tasks, and they are happy to participate in the project, making it better and better day after day.

## Example formal roles

Typical roles in open source projects are as the following

* Creator -  People who created the project
* Owner - People/organizations that officially own the project repository \(could be different from the project creator\)
* Maintainer - People who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. \(They could also be creators or owners of the project.\) In some projects, only the maintainers have commit access to the project.
* Contributor - People who has contribute something back to the project
* Community member - People who has used your project, who may be active in expressing opinions of the project's future or promoting the project to broader audience.

Being a maintainer of a project does not mean that he has to write a lot of codes. He could be the person who has made great efforts in organizing the project, or writing documentation. A maintainer is something with strong responsibility, and is committed to improve it over a long term.

A contributor could be anyone, who has commented on an issue, making a pull request, writing documentation and/or translation. Anyone who has add value to the project is a contributor.

## Formalize the roles

For small projects, the creator, owner and maintainer may be the same people, so adding all contributors in README or CONTRIBUTORS should be good enough.

For bigger projects, it would be nice to have a webpage dedicated to the list of contributors for your project, including the team structures, and team leaders. For example, the Linux Foundation has a webpage for their leaderships. [https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/leadership](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/about/leadership)

Projects with a very active community will have a core team of maintainers. And the community will have a dedicated channel of communication. Sometimes, even people from outside the project will start discussing the project outside the official community channels/forums. For example, developers from different countries will start a new website to discuss the same project in their own language. The FreeCodeCamp project is an example. This is the official forum [https://forum.freecodecamp.com/](https://forum.freecodecamp.com/) and this is the Chinese Gitter chat room[ https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/chinese. ](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/chinese)

Once you have formalize the roles, don't forget to document all of those. It will help others understand the leadership team structure of the project. It is also a good idea to make a formal procedure process for project maintainer / community committee promotion. People who have interests in the project will eventually have the chance to join the leadership.

If your project is on github.com, you could add an organization to it. Github organization make it easier to deal with shared project ownerships.

## Give commit access

Some contributors only make small improvements to the project. In this case, there is no need to grant them commit access, as they will not commit to the project all the time. _Pull Request_, is often used by this type of contributors, to submit their contributions.

If a contributor is constantly active in the project, and make a lot of contributions back, then it is a time to consider to give him commit access. Different projects have different requirements on how to gain commit access. In order to have committer, one must show he is passionate, accountable and skillful.

For projects on github.com, different branches are used for different teams and developers to submit their contributions without causing conflicts among the whole project. It is the job of a project owner/maintainer to decide when to merge different branches.

## Governance structure

Based on the size of the leadership team, open source project governance have the following structure:

* BDFL \(Benevolent Dictator for Life\). BDFL means that one person, or a small number of persons, have a final say in the project.  Smaller projects are probably BDFL by default, because there are only one or two maintainers. A project that originated at a company might also fall into the BDFL category. Projects that are well-known as BDFL include Python, Drupal, Vim, Linux and Scala.
* Meritocracy: In projects that adopts meritocracy, active project contributors are given a formal decision making role. Decisions are usually made based on pure voting consensus. The meritocracy concept was pioneered by the Apache Foundation; all Apache projects are meritocracies.
* Liberal contribution: Under a liberal contribution model, major project decisions are made based on a consensus seeking process \(discuss major grievances\) rather than pure vote, and strive to include as many community perspectives as possible. Popular examples of projects that use a liberal contribution model include Node.js and Rust.
