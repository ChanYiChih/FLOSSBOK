# Project Leadership/Governance

Open source project leadership/governance, is a little bit different from traditional projects. In most companies or organizations, the management is top-down, meaning instructions coming from VP get conveyed to directors, then managers and finally employees. Open source communities and their projects rarely function in that way. Compared to the top-down hierarchical approach, another way is crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is a specific sourcing model in which individuals or organizations use contributions from Internet users to obtain needed services or ideas.

So how are open source projects and communities led? Often in a project, there are different teams responsible for different parts and different features. Teams are loosely coupled, and each team has a team leader. The leaders are a little bit different from traditional company managers, in that he will not go about how things must be done. In open source project, people often volunteer to do some tasks, and they are happy to participate in the project, making it better and better day after day.

## Example formal roles

Typical roles in open source projects are as the following

* Creator -  People who created the project
* Owner - People/organizations that officially own the project repository \(could be different from the project creator\)
* Maintainer - People who are responsible for driving the vision and managing the organizational aspects of the project. \(They could also be creators or owners of the project.\) In some projects, only the maintainers have commit access to the project.
* Contributor - People who has contribute something back to the project
* Community member - People who has used your project, who may be active in expressing opinions of the project's future or promoting the project to broader audience.

Being a maintainer of a project does not mean that he has to write a lot of codes. He could be the person who has made great efforts in organizing the project, or writing documentation. A maintainer is something with strong responsibility, and is committed to improve it over a long term.

A contributor could be anyone, who has commented on an issue, making a pull request, writing documentation and/or translation. Anyone who has add value to the project is a contributor.
