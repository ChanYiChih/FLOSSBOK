# Project Leadership/Governance

Open source project leadership/governance, is a little bit different from traditional projects. In most companies or organizations, the management is top-down, meaning instructions coming from VP get conveyed to directors, then managers and finally employees. Open source communities and their projects rarely function in that way. Compared to the top-down hierarchical approach, another way would be crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing is a specific sourcing model in which individuals or organizations use contributions from Internet users to obtain needed services or ideas.
