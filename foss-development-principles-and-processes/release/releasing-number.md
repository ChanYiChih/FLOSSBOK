# Releasing Number

Before talking about how to make a release, we need to first take a look at how to name releases, and what are contained in the release name. A release means that:

* Some old bugs have been fixed.
* New bugs have been added, except sometimes in the case of security releases or other one-offs.
* New features may have been added.
* New configuration options may have been added, or the meanings of old options may have changed subtly.
* Incompatible changes may have been introduced.

As you can see, not all of things new release may have are good. This is why experienced users approach new releases with some trepidation, especially when the software is mature and was already mostly doing what they wanted. Therefore, there are two purposes of release numbering: firstly, the numbers should unambiguously tell the ordering of releases within a given series, secondly, they should indicate the degree and nature of the changes in each release.
